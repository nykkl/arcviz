## General
- Goal is to investigate which graphs can be drawn with circular arcs
- should be generally flexible
- only needs to support a small number of points
- edges need not be directional
- no autosave!
- same `drawing` <=> same `graph` && same intersections (edge1 edge1 number)

## Todo
- [x] vertices: add, move, remove
- [x] lines: add, move, remove
- [x] toggleable labels for vertices
- [x] visualize intersections (not resolving) (toggleable)
- [x] offer different (predefined) radii (with color to visualize class) (save in same file)
- [x] save & load
	- format: number of points, point per line, curve per line, lines not identified by sorting but by reference to points, 1-based-indexing
	- invalid data doesn't need to be retained on load (can just be ignored)
- [x] .json export
- [x] sidebar for errors, etc.
- [x] remove vertex and edge mode buttons (redundant with edit)
- [ ] move tag in context menu
- [ ] option for showing vertex index on vertices without labels
- [ ] allow changing rendered sizes of vertex, thickness of edge, etc
- [ ] allow changing arc orientation by pulling on edge
- [ ] export to 'ipe editor' format (if feasible)
- [ ] on save normalize connecion notation
	- always put vertex with lowest index first
	- adjust orientation accordingly
	- different ordering should still be allowed for load
- [ ] host web version on server (github.io?)
- [ ] highlight vertices and edges when selected / pulling from
- [ ] snap to grid for multiselect:
	- toggleable
	- 3 szenarios:
		- all vertices are grid aligned: snap
		- no vertices are grid aligned: dont snap
		- some vertices are grid aligned: pick an aligned one and snap all acordingly
- [ ] intersection constraint extension:
	- [ ] differentiate 3 types of intersection constraint:
		- necessary: needs to intersect in exactly 1 place
		- forbidden: may not intersect in any place
		- irrelevant: may or may not intersect in one place
	- [ ] base constraints that can not be overridden by the user:
		- no edge may have 2 intersections ever
		- edges that share a vertex must have 0 intersections
		- if the user tries to specify otherwise: ignore; do not save
	- [ ] allow user to specify intersection constraints on edge pairs
		- [ ] by selecting an existing intersection
		- [ ] by pulling an edge to another
	- [ ] store these constrains as an array (like the edges, i.e. with one space per edge pair whether occupied or not)
	- [ ] color detected intersections accordingly (toggleable)
		- [ ] green: necessary
		- [ ] blue: ok
		- [ ] red: forbidden => error
	- [ ] color edges that should have intersections but dont (toggleable)
